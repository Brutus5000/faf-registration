# FAF Registration

An Angular app dedicated to the registration process for FAForever.com.

Experience has shown that the current process is not sufficient resulting in a huge user loss in the onboarding process. This application tries to tackle some issues:

- Step-based guide through the process in a useful order
- Offering language selection with hot-swapping of translations
- Helpful input validation
- Proper parsing of API error messages and giving useful hints to resolve error
- FAQ and info texts where reasonable
